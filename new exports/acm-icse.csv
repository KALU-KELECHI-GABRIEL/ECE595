Research has shown that serious games provide benefits including the development of problem solving skills and increased engagement in the learning process. Despite the benefits, a major challenge of developing serious games is their ability to accommodate students with different educational backgrounds and levels of competency. Learners with a high-level of competence may find a serious games to be too easy or boring, while learners with low-level competence may be frequently frustrated or find it difficult to progress through the game. One solution to this challenge is to use automated adaptation that can alter game content and adjust game tasks to a level appropriate for the learner. The use of adaptation has been successfully utilized in educational domains outside of Software Engineering, but has not been applied to serious programming games. This paper presents GidgetML, an adaptive version of the Gidget programming game, that uses machine learning to modify game tasks based on assessing and predicting learners' competencies. To assess the benefits of adaptation, we have conducted a study involving 100 students in a first-year university programming course. Our study compared the use of Gidget (non-adaptive) with GidgetML (adaptive) and found that students who played Gidget during lab sessions varied significantly in their performance while this variance was significantly reduced for students who played GidgetML.","2020","2024-04-16 18:27:21","2024-04-16 18:27:21","","184–192","","","","","","","ICSE-SEET '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seoul, South Korea","","","","computer education; computer science; education; game-based learning; machine learning; programming; serious games; software engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What challenges should automated repair tools address? What are the repair patterns whose automation could help developers? Which repair patterns should be assigned a higher priority for building automated bug repair tools? This work presents a comprehensive study of bug fix patterns to address these questions. We have studied 415 repairs from Stack Overflow and 555 repairs from GitHub for five popular deep learning libraries Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow, Theano, and Torch to understand challenges in repairs and bug repair patterns. Our key findings reveal that DNN bug fix patterns are distinctive compared to traditional bug fix patterns; the most common bug fix patterns are fixing data dimension and neural network connectivity; DNN bug fixes have the potential to introduce adversarial vulnerabilities; DNN bug fixes frequently introduce new bugs; and DNN bug localization, reuse of trained model, and coping with frequent releases are major challenges faced by developers when fixing bugs.

How to maximize the computing efficiency of such programs is essential for many application domains, which has drawn lots of recent attention. This work points out a common limitation in existing efforts: they focus their views only on the static computation graphs specified by library APIs, but leave the influence from the hosting Python code largely unconsidered. The limitation often causes them to miss the big picture and hence many important optimization opportunities. This work proposes a new approach named HARP to address the problem. HARP enables holistic analysis that spans across computation graphs and their hosting Python code. HARP achieves it through a set of novel techniques: analytics-conscious speculative analysis to circumvent Python complexities, a unified representation augmented computation graphs to capture all dimensions of knowledge related with the holistic analysis, and conditioned feedback mechanism to allow risk-controlled aggressive analysis.

It is important to reason about the trustworthiness of the model's predictions with unseen data during deployment. Existing methods for specifying and verifying traditional software are insufficient for this task, as they cannot handle the complexity of DNN model architecture and expected outcomes. In this work, we propose a novel technique that uses rules derived from neural network computations to infer data preconditions for a DNN model to determine the trustworthiness of its predictions. Our approach, DeepInfer involves introducing a novel abstraction for a trained DNN model that enables weakest precondition reasoning using Dijkstra's Predicate Transformer Semantics. By deriving rules over the inductive type of neural network abstract representation, we can overcome the matrix dimensionality issues that arise from the backward non-linear computation from the output layer to the input layer. We utilize the weakest precondition computation using rules of each kind of activation function to compute layer-wise precondition from the given postcondition on the final output of a deep neural network. We extensively evaluated DeepInfer on 29 real-world DNN models using four different datasets collected from five different sources and demonstrated the utility, effectiveness, and performance improvement over closely related work. DeepInfer efficiently detects correct and incorrect predictions of high-accuracy models with high recall (0.98) and high F-1 score (0.84) and has significantly improved over the prior technique, SelfChecker. The average runtime overhead of DeepInfer is low, 0.22 sec for all the unseen datasets. We also compared runtime overhead using the same hardware settings and found that DeepInfer is 3.27 times faster than SelfChecker, the state-of-the-art in this area.","2024","2024-04-16 18:27:21","2024-04-16 18:27:21","","","","","","","","","ICSE '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: <conf-loc>, <city>Lisbon</city>, <country>Portugal</country>, </conf-loc>","","","","deep neural networks; trustworthiness; weakest precondition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What if we can build new CNN models by reusing parts from previously built CNN models? What if we can improve a CNN model by replacing (possibly faulty) parts with other parts? In both cases, instead of training, can we identify the part responsible for each output class (module) in the model(s) and reuse or replace only the desired output classes to build a model? Prior work has proposed decomposing dense-based networks into modules (one for each output class) to enable reusability and replaceability in various scenarios. However, this work is limited to the dense layers and is based on the one-to-one relationship between the nodes in consecutive layers. Due to the shared architecture in the CNN model, prior work cannot be adapted directly. In this paper, we propose to decompose a CNN model used for image classification problems into modules for each output class. These modules can further be reused or replaced to build a new model. We have evaluated our approach with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet tiny datasets with three variations of ResNet models and found that enabling decomposition comes with a small cost (1.77% and 0.85% for top-1 and top-5 accuracy, respectively). Also, building a model by reusing or replacing modules can be done with a 2.3% and 0.5% average loss of accuracy. Furthermore, reusing and replacing these modules reduces CO2e emission by 37 times compared to training the model from scratch.","2022","2024-04-16 18:27:22","2024-04-16 18:27:22","","524–535","","","","","","","ICSE '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","cnn; decomposition; deep learning; deep neural network; modularity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More, and more diverse, clean, labeled data is better for training; but constructing good-quality datasets is time-consuming and challenging. Ways of augmenting the volume and diversity of clean, labeled data generally have wide applicability. For some languages (e.g., Ruby) labeled data is less abundant; in others (e.g., JavaScript) the available data maybe more focused on some application domains, and thus less diverse. As a way around such data bottlenecks, we present evidence suggesting that human-written code in different languages (which performs the same function), is rather similar, and particularly preserving of identifier naming patterns; we further present evidence suggesting that identifiers are a very important element of training data for software engineering tasks. We leverage this rather fortuitous phenomenon to find evidence that available multilingual training data (across different languages) can be used to amplify performance. We study this for 3 different tasks: code summarization, code retrieval, and function naming.

As these apps become more complex, it is critical to provide automated analysis techniques to ensure the correctness, security, and performance of these apps. A key component for these automated analysis techniques is to create a graphical user interface (GUI) model of an app, i.e., a window transition graph (WTG), that models windows and transitions among the windows. While existing work has provided both static and dynamic analysis to build the WTG for an app, the constructed WTG misses many transitions or contains many infeasible transitions due to the coverage issues of dynamic analysis and over-approximation of the static analysis. We propose ProMal, a ""tribrid"" analysis that synergistically combines static analysis, dynamic analysis, and machine learning to construct a precise WTG. Specifically, ProMal first applies static analysis to build a static WTG, and then applies dynamic analysis to verify the transitions in the static WTG. For the unverified transitions, ProMal further provides machine learning techniques that leverage runtime information (i.e., screenshots, UI layouts, and text information) to predict whether they are feasible transitions. Our evaluations on 40 real-world apps demonstrate the superiority of ProMal in building WTGs over static analysis, dynamic analysis, and machine learning techniques when they are applied separately.","2022","2024-04-16 18:27:22","2024-04-16 18:27:22","","1755–1767","","","","","","","ICSE '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","deep learning; mobile apps; static analysis; window transition graph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A software engineering problem with deep learning is that finding an appropriate convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the task can be a challenge for developers. Recent work on AutoML, more precisely neural architecture search (NAS), embodied by tools like Auto-Keras aims to solve this problem by essentially viewing it as a search problem where the starting point is a default CNN model, and mutation of this CNN model allows exploration of the space of CNN models to find a CNN model that will work best for the problem. These works have had significant success in producing high-accuracy CNN models. There are two problems, however. First, NAS can be very costly, often taking several hours to complete. Second, CNN models produced by NAS can be very complex that makes it harder to understand them and costlier to train them. We propose a novel approach for NAS, where instead of starting from a default CNN model, the initial model is selected from a repository of models extracted from GitHub. The intuition being that developers solving a similar problem may have developed a better starting point compared to the default model. We also analyze common layer patterns of CNN models in the wild to understand changes that the developers make to improve their models. Our approach uses commonly occurring changes as mutation operators in NAS. We have extended Auto-Keras to implement our approach. Our evaluation using 8 top voted problems from Kaggle for tasks including image classification and image regression shows that given the same search time, without loss of accuracy, Manas produces models with 42.9% to 99.6% fewer number of parameters than Auto-Keras' models. Benchmarked on GPU, Manas' models train 30.3% to 641.6% faster than Auto-Keras' models.","2022","2024-04-16 18:27:22","2024-04-16 18:27:22","","1368–1380","","","","","","","ICSE '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","AutoML; deep learning; mining software repositories; MSR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, its usage is energy demanding and contributes to the increased CO2 emissions, and has a great financial cost as well. Even though there are many studies that examine the capabilities of dl, only a few focus on its green aspects, such as energy consumption.This paper aims at raising awareness of the costs incurred when using different dl frameworks. To this end, we perform a thorough empirical study to measure and compare the energy consumption and run-time performance of six different dl models written in the two most popular dl frameworks, namely PyTorch and TensorFlow. We use a well-known benchmark of dl models, DeepLearningExamples, created by nvidia, to compare both the training and inference costs of dl. Finally, we manually investigate the functions of these frameworks that took most of the time to execute in our experiments.The results of our empirical study reveal that there is a statistically significant difference between the cost incurred by the two dl frameworks in 94% of the cases studied. While TensorFlow achieves significantly better energy and run-time performance than PyTorch, and with large effect sizes in 100% of the cases for the training phase, PyTorch instead exhibits significantly better energy and run-time performance than TensorFlow in the inference phase for 66% of the cases, always, with large effect sizes. Such a large difference in performance costs does not, however, seem to affect the accuracy of the models produced, as both frameworks achieve comparable scores under the same configurations. Our manual analysis, of the documentation and source code of the functions examined, reveals that such a difference in performance costs is under-documented, in these frameworks. This suggests that developers need to improve the documentation of their dl frameworks, the source code of the functions used in these frameworks, as well as to enhance existing dl algorithms.","2022","2024-04-16 18:27:22","2024-04-16 18:27:22","","1082–1094","","","","","","","ICSE '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","APIs; deep learning; energy consumption; run-time performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even when misbehavior is exposed, it is often unclear whether the culprit is inside the cognitive ML API or the code using the API.This paper presents Keeper, a new testing tool for software that uses cognitive ML APIs. Keeper designs a pseudo-inverse function for each ML API that reverses the corresponding cognitive task in an empirical way (e.g., an image search engine pseudo-reverses the image-classification API), and incorporates these pseudo-inverse functions into a symbolic execution engine to automatically generate relevant image/text/audio inputs and judge output correctness. Once misbehavior is exposed, Keeper attempts to change how ML APIs are used in software to alleviate the misbehavior. Our evaluation on a variety of open-source applications shows that Keeper greatly improves the branch coverage, while identifying many previously unknown bugs.","2022","2024-04-16 18:27:22","2024-04-16 18:27:22","","212–224","","","","","","","ICSE '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","machine learning; machine learning API; software testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes the use of a single hyperheuristic algorithm that learns search strategies across a broad range of problem instances, providing a single generalist approach. We have developed a Hyperheuristic algorithm for CIT, and report experiments that show that our algorithm competes with known best solutions across constrained and unconstrained problems: For all 26 real-world subjects, it equals or outperforms the best result previously reported in the literature.

Despite the importance of NFRs for ML systems, our understanding of their definitions and scope—and of the extent of existing research—is lacking compared to our understanding in traditional domains.Building on an investigation into importance and treatment of ML system NFRs in industry, we make three contributions towards narrowing this gap: (1) we present clusters of ML system NFRs based on shared characteristics, (2) we use Scopus search results—as well as inter-coder reliability on a sample of NFRs—to estimate the number of relevant studies on a subset of the NFRs, and (3), we use our initial reading of titles and abstracts in each sample to define the scope of NFRs over parts of the system (e.g., training data, ML model). These initial findings form the groundwork for future research in this emerging domain.","2023","2024-04-16 18:27:23","2024-04-16 18:27:23","","29–36","","","","","","","SE4RAI '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","machine learning; machine learning systems; non-functional requirements; requirements engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering aspects of responsible AI, this number is even lower, opening up a field of research with many possibilities.

While large organizations rely on periodic training to evade drift, the reality is that not all organizations have the data and the resources required to do so. We propose a process for drift behavior analysis at model development time that determines the set of metrics and thresholds to monitor for runtime drift detection. Better understanding of how models will react to drift before they are deployed, combined with a mechanism for how to detect this drift in production, is an important aspect of Responsible AI. The toolset and experiments reported in this paper provide an initial demonstration of (1) drift behavior analysis as a part of the model development process, (2) metrics and thresholds that need to be monitored for drift detection in production, and (3) libraries for drift detection that can be embedded in production monitoring infrastructures.","2023","2024-04-16 18:27:23","2024-04-16 18:27:23","","37–44","","","","","","","SE4RAI '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","drift detection; machine learning; model monitoring; responsible AI; software engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although many studies focus on adapting ML software engineering (SE) approaches and techniques, few studies have summarized the status and challenges of operationalizing ML models. Model operationalization encompasses all steps after model training and evaluation, including packaging the model in a format appropriate for deployment, publishing to a model registry or storage, integrating the model into a broader software system, serving, and monitoring. This study is the first systematic literature review investigating the techniques, tools, and infrastructures to operationalize ML models. After reviewing 24 primary studies, the results show that there are a number of tools for most use cases to operationalize ML models and cloud deployment in particular. The review also revealed several research opportunities, such as dynamic model-switching, continuous model-monitoring, and efficient edge ML deployments.","2023","2024-04-16 18:27:23","2024-04-16 18:27:23","","1–8","","","","","","","SE4RAI '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","deployment; machine learning; MLOps; operationalization; systematic literature review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code that supports symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development tends to produce DL code that is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, less error-prone imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. While hybrid approaches aim for the ""best of both worlds,"" the challenges in applying them in the real world are largely unknown. We conduct a data-driven analysis of challenges—and resultant bugs—involved in writing reliable yet performant imperative DL code by studying 250 open-source projects, consisting of 19.7 MLOC, along with 470 and 446 manually examined code patches and bug reports, respectively. The results indicate that hybridization: (i) is prone to API misuse, (ii) can result in performance degradation—the opposite of its intention, and (iii) has limited application due to execution mode incompatibility. We put forth several recommendations, best practices, and anti-patterns for effectively hybridizing imperative DL code, potentially benefiting DL practitioners, API designers, tool developers, and educators.","2022","2024-04-16 18:27:23","2024-04-16 18:27:23","","469–481","","","","","","","MSR '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","deep learning; empirical studies; graph-based execution; hybrid programming paradigms; imperative programs; software evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) helps developers identify vulnerable libraries used by an application. A key challenge is the identification of libraries related to a given reported vulnerability in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which may not explicitly indicate the affected libraries. Recently, researchers have tried to address the problem of identifying the libraries from an NVD report by treating it as an extreme multi-label learning (XML) problem, characterized by its large number of possible labels and severe data sparsity. As input, the NVD report is provided, and as output, a set of relevant libraries is returned.In this work, we evaluated multiple XML techniques. While previous work only evaluated a traditional XML technique, FastXML, we trained four other traditional XML models (DiSMEC, Parabel, Bonsai, ExtremeText) as well as two deep learning-based models (XML-CNN and LightXML). We compared both their effectiveness and the time cost of training and using the models for predictions. We find that other than DiSMEC and XML-CNN, recent XML models outperform the FastXML model by 3%–10% in terms of F1-scores on Top-k (k=1,2,3) predictions. Furthermore, we observe significant improvements in both the training and prediction time of these XML models, with Bonsai and Parabel model achieving 627x and 589x faster training time and 12x faster prediction time from the FastXML baseline. We discuss the implications of our experimental results and highlight limitations for future work to address.","2022","2024-04-16 18:27:23","2024-04-16 18:27:23","","178–189","","","","","","","ICPC '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event","","","","machine learning; multi-label classification; vulnerability report","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability of these models to generalize well has ushered in tremendous advances in many fields such as natural language processing (NLP). Recent research in the software engineering (SE) community has demonstrated the usefulness of applying NLP techniques to software corpora. Hence, we motivate deep learning for software language modeling, highlighting fundamental differences between state-of-the-practice software language models and connectionist models. Our deep learning models are applicable to source code files (since they only require lexically analyzed source code written in any programming language) and other types of artifacts. We show how a particular deep learning model can remember its state to effectively model sequential data, e.g., streaming software tokens, and the state is shown to be much more expressive than discrete tokens in a prefix. Then we instantiate deep learning models and show that deep learning induces high-quality models compared to n-grams and cache-based n-grams on a corpus of Java projects. We experiment with two of the models' hyperparameters, which govern their capacity and the amount of context they use to inform predictions, before building several committees of software language models to aid generalization. Then we apply the deep learning models to code suggestion and demonstrate their effectiveness at a real SE task compared to state-of-the-practice models. Finally, we propose avenues for future work, where deep learning can be brought to bear to support model-based testing, improve software lexicons, and conceptualize software artifacts. Thus, our work serves as the first step toward deep learning software repositories.","2015","2024-04-16 18:27:23","2024-04-16 18:27:23","","334–345","","","","","","","MSR '15","","","","IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","Place: Florence, Italy","","","","deep learning; machine learning; n-grams; neural networks; software language models; software repositories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing number of dependent applications, heterogeneous technologies and wide usage of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), where numerous services communicate with each other, makes testing of such systems challenging. For testing these software systems, the concept of service virtualization is gaining popularity. Service virtualization is an automated technique to mimic the behavior of a given real service. Services can be classified as stateless or stateful services. Many services are stateful in nature. Although there are works in the literature for virtualization of state-less services, no such solution exists for stateful services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for stateful service virtualization. We employ classification based and sequence-to-sequence based machine learning algorithms in developing our solutions. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on two data sets collected from real life services and obtain promising results.","2018","2024-04-16 18:27:23","2024-04-16 18:27:23","","9–15","","","","","","","AST '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Gothenburg, Sweden","","","","machine learning; service virtualization; software testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
